The class is based on the following paper:

> Buch I, Giorgino T, De Fabritiis G. Complete reconstruction of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process by molecular dynamics simulations. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2011 Jun 6;108(25):10184–9. 

To extract collective variables from simulations, use one of the libraries explained in the previous lecture, e.g. as  described in
