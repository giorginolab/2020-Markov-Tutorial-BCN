# Markov-Tutorial-BCN-2019
Material for the Markov + MD Lecture @ Master MSI Barcelona

These files show how to perform a basic Markov-based analysis from scratch in the R language; and how to apply it
to a more realistic target-inhibitor example (in Python, using the [HTMD](https://www.htmd.org/) library).

## Description

The `.Rmd` files are best viewed with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

They contain blocks of descriptions intermixed with code and figures generated by executing the code. 

If you don't have RStudio but have R, you can preview the notebooks by either downloading the corresponding HTML files and opening them in a browser, or via these links:

* [3_MarkovOnLargeDataset.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/giorginolab/Markov-Tutorial-BCN-2019/blob/master/3_MarkovOnLargeDataset.html)

The `.ipynb`Â files are similar, but for Python code. They can be previewed online.
