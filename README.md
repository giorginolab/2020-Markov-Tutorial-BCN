The class is based on the following papers:

> Buch I, Giorgino T, De Fabritiis G. Complete reconstruction of an enzyme-inhibitor binding process by molecular dynamics simulations. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2011 Jun 6;108(25):10184–9. 

> Chodera JD, Noé F. Markov state models of biomolecular conformational dynamics. Current Opinion in Structural Biology. 2014 Apr 1;25(Supplement C):135–44. 

To extract collective variables from simulations, use one of the libraries explained in the previous lecture, e.g. as  described in

> Giorgino T. Analysis libraries for molecular trajectories: a cross-language synopsis. In: Bonomi M, Camilloni C, editors. Biomolecular Simulations: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press; 2019 [cited 2019 Apr 8]. p. 503–27. (Methods in Molecular Biology). (Preprint available on the last lecture's Git repository)
